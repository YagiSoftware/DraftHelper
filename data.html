          DraftHelper Data Protection Agreement
          <br><br>
          <strong>DraftHelper</strong> "the App‚Äù provides draft order editing service (including checkout link generation, applying discount, rearranging line items and editing line item properties) "the Service" to merchants who use Shopify to power their stores. This Data Protection Agreement describes what data is collected, used, and stored in database when you install or use the App in connection with your Shopify-supported store.
        </p>
        <article class="mt-8 text-xl text-gray-500 leading-8">
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Personal Information the App Collects</h3>
          When you install the App, we are automatically able to access certain types of information from your Shopify account:
          <br><br>
          Your shop name and shop contact email, this is only used for support and emergency contact purpose.
          <br><br>
          Your shop's location ID and name, this is only used for when you use the deduct inventory feature, which the app will deduct inventory from the selected location.
          <br><br>
          Draft Orders data, including line items and customers details, this is only used for the app to function.
          <br><br>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Draft Order Information the App Collects</h3>

          For all of the app functions, the app collects information from the draft order, including the line item quantity, line item properties, product ID, product name, product image, product price, variant ID, variant name, variant SKU, draft order ID, draft order notes and draft order tags.
          <br><br>
          From the information above, only the product ID, variant ID and draft order ID are stored in the app database, for future identification and access purpose, no other data from the draft order is stored in the app database.
          <br><br>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Customer Information the App Collects</h3>
          For the "Generate discountable checkout link" / "Checkout link" function, in addition to the draft order information mentioned in the previous section, the app also collects the draft order's customer information, including customer name, customer email, customer shipping address and customer billing address.
          <br><br>
          These customer information is needed to generate a checkout, which the checkout will then be populated with the customer name, email, shipping address and billing address, so the customer will not need to type them again when they access the checkout link generated.
          <br><br>
          These customer information (name, email, shipping address and billing address) is never stored in the app database, the app will request these information from Shopify every time a checkout link is generated, and they will be discarded once the checkout link is generated, these information are only kept in ephemeral Random Access Memory (RAM) during the generation of checkout link.
          <br><br>

          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Data Security</h3>
          We use HTTPS / TLS 1.3 (AES_128_GCM_SHA256) to encrypt the data in transit for the app, no customer data is ever stored in the database. The database only store the following data : your shop name, your shop contact email, you shop location IDs, product ID, variant ID, draft order ID, checkout ID and quantity of line items.
          <br><br>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Changes</h3>
          We may update this data protection agreement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
